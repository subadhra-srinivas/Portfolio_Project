# Subadhra's Portfolio Project

## About:

This is a final project from the Intro to HTML & CSS / Responsive Design / Responsive images courses.
We are provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and we must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.
We developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio
projects we completed throughout the Nanodegree program.
